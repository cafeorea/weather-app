The 'House On The Hill Weather App' project was my response to the SheCodesPlus course final assignment.

The project specifications required me to create a vanilla JavaScript app that would display temperatures for a given location in both celsius and farenheit, accompany that temperature with a matching weather icon, and project a five day forecast for the location.

There is still a lot that I would like to do with the design of the application, and the code I wrote needs some major refactoring, but I am very pleased with the result: my very first "real" project.

The process of designing this application involved a lot of trial and error with:

- API
- AJAX/AXIOS
- BootStrap (not used for this project, but can be found in my practice repository)
- Implementing a hand-drawn png image
- Hosting on Netlify
- Frequent GitHub usage
- Pushing my knowledge of CSS/HTML/JavaScript

I started learning to code on April 7, 2021, and the first fully-responsive (not yet refactored) project was completed on July 12 - my 97th day of learning to code.

Future plans:

- Refactor the code (necessary - plenty of lines here could be replaced with a simple function call)
- Responsive night/day design based on the time at chosen location.

Thank you for reading!
